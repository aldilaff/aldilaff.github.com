Hi! 

My name is Faisal and I am an international student studying Computer Science here at UT. I am fourth year student hoping to graduate this May.

### What did you do this past week?

This past week I started working on our first project, Collatz. I created my private repo and was also added to the public testing repo. I currently have a basic working solution. I wanted to start early so I would have enough time to complete the project. I also created this blog.

### Whatâ€™s in your way?

I currently need to to optimize my solution to be more efficient time and space wise.

### What will you do next week?

For next week I plan to continue working on my Collatz solution and hopefully finish it soon. I also plan on doing the readings for this week to be prepared for the quizzes.

### Class Experience 

This class is very similar in format to the Object Oreinted Programming (OOP) class which I took with Professor Downing a couple of semesters ago. However, I think that using Python in this class will be a lot more enjoyable than using C++, which was used in OOP. I am also very excited to take another class with Professor Fraij after having taken Algorithms with him last semester. 

### Tip-Of-The-Week

If you have an Amazon Echo and want to develop an Alexa skill, I would recommend looking at [Flask-ASK](https://github.com/johnwheeler/flask-ask) (Alexa Skills Kit). Flask-ask uses python and flask, both of which will be used in this class.
