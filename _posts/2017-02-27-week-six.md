title: Week Six!

### What did you do this past week?

We did not have a project due this past week so I did not end up doing a lot of things related to SWE. Most of what I did for SWE was going to class and participating in in-class activities.

### What's in your way?

Currently not much. But we do have a test coming up on a Tuesday.

### What will you do next week?

The early days of this week will be spent on studying for the test and preparing my notes sheet for that. We have covered a lot of things in the past couple of weeks and some of them were confusing. So it would good to go over them again and make notes of the small differences. Also, it would probably be a good idea to skim over readings before the test. I have another test coming up on Friday so I will try to start preparing for that early on.

### Tip-of-the-week:

If you own a Roku, you can use HTTP requests to control it. One thing that I am trying to figure out how to do is turning a Roku TV ON using HTTP requests. Here is their documentation for the other commands https://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/External+Control+Guide . One tricky part was figuring out the IP address of the Roku everytime you turn it on. One way to work around that is by assigning the Roku a reserved IP through your router.
