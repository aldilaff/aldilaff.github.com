title: Week Seven!

### What did you do this past week?

We had our first test this past Tuesday. On Thursday we had a guest speaker from Mutual Mobile who talked about their expeirences as a Software Engineer and tips that they had for us after we join the workforce.

### What's in your way?

Currently not much. Looking forward to starting the new project.

### What will you do next week?

I will try to do the readings as a preparation for class. The new project is going to be announced this Tuesday so that should be interesting. It will also be interesting to work in a relatively big group again. The last time I worked in a group this big on a software project was around two years ago. I am also looking forward to see what technologies we need to use and hopefully read up on them if I have not used them before. Also having the next couple of projects dependent on each other will also be interesting to work with because code we write this week will be used two months from now.

### Tip-of-the-week:

I had to work on windows recently and found out about gitbash which seems to be a part of git for windows. Git bash  is described as "a BASH emulation used to run Git from the command line. *NIX users should feel right at home, as the BASH emulation behaves just like the "git" command in LINUX and UNIX environments."
