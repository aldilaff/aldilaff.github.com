title: Week Two!

### What did you do this past week?

This past week we continued working on IDB phase 1. I helped work on defining the models and setting up the unit tests. It was an interesting experience working on defining database models after having been introduced to them before but not really using them. Defining many-to-many relationships seemed a bit too complicated but following documentation helped clear some of the information on how to define it. Hopefully using it won’t be as hard. 

Most of the code we wrote on the backend exists, but we don’t know if it works on not because we cannot run it. So it will be interesting to see all the errors we get once we hook everything up.

### What's in your way?

Currently, not much. Waiting for the new project to be announced.

### What will you do next week?

I will try to do some of the readings before class in order to be ready for the quiz. Hopefully also get a head start on the new project.

### Class Experience

This week we covered Theta join and normal join. Normal join is really confusing and will need some more review before our next test. On Thursday we covered some of the ways a server can provide information. We mostly focused on xml but we looked at some JSON examples too.

### Tip-of-the-week
If you’re using nodejs and need to find the IP address of the server, you can do something like this:
```
var server = http.createServer(app);
console.log(server.address())
```
