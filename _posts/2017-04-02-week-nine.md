title: Week Eight!
---

### What did you do this past week?

This past week was probably the busiest week of my semester so far with three tests and a drawing for my art class. Sadly, this did not give me a lot of chance to work on things for this class. However, we are currently working on finalizing our API data points and making sure that it works the in a way that our front end can easily utilize. 

### What's in your way?

This week is a lot easier in terms of the number of things due which should give me more time to work on our project and this class. Currently we just have a couple of things that we need to do before we turn in our project.

### What will you do next week?

We currently have to update our apiary api documentation to reflect some small changes that we did while finalizing our API endpoints. Then we have to work on the unit tests, making sure that they work, and figuring out a way to run them from the about page. We also need to make sure that TravisCI is passing before we turn in our code. We also have to update our write up to reflect the new changes.

### Class Experience

Sadly, I missed class this week so I donâ€™t have much to say about the class experience.

### Tip-of-the-week

JetBrains offers a student license that includes great editors like IntelliJ and PyCharm. PyCharm can be used for these last couple of projects. More information can be found [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/)
