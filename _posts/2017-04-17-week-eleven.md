### What did you do this past week?

The last and final project was announced on Tuesday. Sadly, I haven’t done much this past week for that. I did however get updates on a pull request that I opened around a year ago for a bug that I found in a library I was using. I never thought I would hear back regarding that PR.

### What's in your way?
Currently not much besides finishing up the last project.


### What will you do next week?
This week I am hoping that we finish the last project a bit before Thursday so we can double check that all the requirements have been completed and then submit our project. We’ll be working on adding more unit tests and setting 


### Class Experience

I missed class on Tuesday. However, on Thursday we discussed method overriding and how it is different from method overloading. We also discussed dynamic binding which was a bit confusing when it comes to calls to private methods that exists in the parent class but are overridden in the inheriting class. I thought that since the inheriting class overrode that method, it would call the one in the inheriting class. However, it turns out if that method is private and it was called from the parent class, then the private method is actually called from the parent class too.

### Tip-of-the-week

Every Monday, the CS department sends out emails detailing a lot of the events happening around the department for the upcoming week.
