### What did you do this past week?

	Our group finished working on the last project last week with enough time to double check that everything is working fine. We also worked on creating our presentation which included critiquing our website and another groupâ€™s website. 
	We also worked on creating the extra credit presentation on the topic of python loggers. We hope that people enjoy it if we get chosen to present.

### What's in your way?
Currently not much besides finding the motivation to finish the semester strong.

### What will you do next week?
If we get chosen to present our extra credit, then we will do that on this Tuesday. I will also try to catch up with some of the readings that I have not gotten the chance to read yet. If I find the time, I will try to start studying for the SWE test.

### Class Experience
We covered reflection and how to use that in our journey of refactoring the store example. We also covered a couple of software design patterns like Creational Patterns, Factory Method Pattern, Abstract Factory Pattern, and Prototype Pattern. Covering all of them in a short amount between them was a bit confusing. I definitely need to revisit them.


### Tip-of-the-week
