### What did you do this past week?

This past week, we presented our extra credit on python Logging. We also got to see the other group’s extra credit presentations which were interesting. Some groups presented their finals project on Thursday and it was great to see what other groups did.

### What's in your way?
We have our second/last midterm this Thursday. I should start studying for that soon.

### What will you do next week?
This week will be a very busy week for me as I don’t have any finals (second time this year that I got lucky with not having finals). However, this means that everything will be due in the next 5 days. This includes: three midterms, three paintings for my drawing class, a group project, a presentation, and a homework. It should be fun!

### Class Experience

It was a fun experience seeing the other groups present their finals projects and their extra credits. It was interesting listening to why they made some decisions that we might have done differently. I also got to learn about new things that could have saved me a lot of time. For example, there’s a chrome plugin that clears your cache. This way, you don’t have to go to incognito mode every time you’re developing or updating a web page.

### Tip-of-the-week

/r/programming on reddit usually has great articles. I would recommend sorting the article by top for links from the past week to see some good articles from that week.
